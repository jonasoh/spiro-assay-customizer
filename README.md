# SPIRO Assay Customizer
SPIRO Assay Customizer is a simple GUI for managing output from [SPIRO Assays](https://github.com/jiaxuanleong/SPIRO.Assays). The GUI allows adding new groups, rearranging seeds/seedlings between groups, and removing seeds/seedlings from analysis. It can handle output files from both the Germination and Root Growth assays.

This application is cross-platform, and should run on MacOS, Windows, common Unixes, and Linux.
